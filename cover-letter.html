				<p><span>Dear Hiring Recruiter</span></p>
				<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to apply for the <strong>Web Developer</strong> opening at Microcenter. I have been shopping at your store for many years. I always run to the closest Microcenter for my pc parts and have checked the website numerous times. Your company has always been the go-to spot for enthusiastic PC builders and people looking for the best deal. I am excited to be able to work and update the company's website according to your plans.</p>

				<p>In my previous role as a <strong>Tech Support Specialist</strong> while I worked at Crunchyroll, I strengthened my skills in <mark>HTML, Javascript, and CSS</mark> by troubleshooting bugs on the front-end side, and helping <mark>redesign the UI every week</mark>.</p>
				<p>When I worked at Best Buy, I learned much about basic tech skills. I helped customers with their PC builds, which parts would be compatible and not bottleneck. I used a Python script to automate inventory, which took the team some time to get used to. Each <em>step</em> I took helped pave the way for me to become strong within the tech field. I believe that I can take each of these skills and more and bring them over to your company for a fresh start.</p>
